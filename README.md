## PROJECTS

# Project 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

**Project Link: https://github.com/swasthik62/swasthik62.github.io/blob/main/README.md**

**Scenario**
As a data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

**Share & Act**

Once the analysis is completed and we have obtained the insights, now we have to share this information to the relevant stakeholders. In this case, a presentation will be made for the Director of Marketing outlining the business task, assumptions made using the data we had and translating the insights from the analysis to actionable recommendations.

1. Based on my analysis, these were my observations:

2. A significant amount of subscribed riders use Cyclistic during the mid weeks, notably Monday To Friday and the data shows a higher average trip duration of the mid week day itself.

3. As in the weekend the Subscribers will slightly goes down and the slightly raise in the random customers.

4. We can clearly see in the month of July there is pathtic drop in the users.

5. There is more users in the mid year like June and August but as the year end the numbers of user will going down.

6. When its come to the average day usage there is high users in the Evening, and very lesss users in the Night time. and the numbers of the "customer" is very less in the Mornig and night time.

Most number of casual rider trips were shown to be during the summer months of May, June, August and september and in the month of July there is rapid degrowing in a single month because of the heavy rain. There is decline during the winter months.

# Project 2: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

scenario
Here in this project as a data analyst i will be working for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, and meet different characters and team members. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights im discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. I will present my analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with my high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

# Share and Act

Once the analysis is completed and we have obtained the insights, now we have to share this information to the relevant key stakeholders. In this case, a presentation will be made for the stakeholders outlining the business task, assumptions made using the data we had and translating the insights from the analysis to actionable recommendations.

Recommendations for the Bellabeat Spring Device:

1. They need to share their testimonial and success stories and also they should collect the feedback from their customer
2. Adjust the algorithm in the Spring bottle tracking device to sync with the Ivy health tracker to alert users “aggresively” between 5 pm and 7 pm to increase their water intake.
2. Women who work full-time jobs  and spend a lot of time at the computer/in a meeting/ focused on work they are doing.
3. These women do some light activity to stay healthy (according to the activity type analysis). Even though they need to improve their everyday activity to have health benefits. They might need some knowledge about developing healthy habits or motivation to keep going.
4. Now is an excellent time to start a virtual community. Users will feel more supported if community-building is emphasized throughout the messaging and campaign.
5. The pandemic caused a lot of losses, now that it is almost in the past, Bellabeat has the option to remarket her products to current users or those who have recently stopped using their products.
