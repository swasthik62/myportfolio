## DATA ANALYTICS PROJECT

### PROJECT 1 - REAL ESTATE

**Problem**
A real estate agency wanted to reduce the negotiation time and improve
closure for buyers and sellers of homes by ensuring that both sides were advised well on the potential
sale/purchase price of the home. To that end the agency wanted to predict a transaction price for all the
houses in its market which would be as close as possible to a price where the transaction would take place.
Data regarding all possible variables and qualities of over 10,000 houses sold in the past was collected and
analyzed.
**Solution**: Created a predictive model using linear regression and implemented CvTuning with the help of
Random forest and GBM to arrive at a potential transaction price for all future transactions. Over the next 6
months, negotiation time was brought down from 27 days on average to 21 days. Deal closure went up by
18%.




# Project 2: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

scenario
Here in this project as a data analyst i will be working for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, and meet different characters and team members. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights im discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. I will present my analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with my high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

# Share and Act

Once the analysis is completed and we have obtained the insights, now we have to share this information to the relevant key stakeholders. In this case, a presentation will be made for the stakeholders outlining the business task, assumptions made using the data we had and translating the insights from the analysis to actionable recommendations.

Recommendations for the Bellabeat Spring Device:

1. They need to share their testimonial and success stories and also they should collect the feedback from their customer
2. Adjust the algorithm in the Spring bottle tracking device to sync with the Ivy health tracker to alert users “aggresively” between 5 pm and 7 pm to increase their water intake.
2. Women who work full-time jobs  and spend a lot of time at the computer/in a meeting/ focused on work they are doing.
3. These women do some light activity to stay healthy (according to the activity type analysis). Even though they need to improve their everyday activity to have health benefits. They might need some knowledge about developing healthy habits or motivation to keep going.
4. Now is an excellent time to start a virtual community. Users will feel more supported if community-building is emphasized throughout the messaging and campaign.
5. The pandemic caused a lot of losses, now that it is almost in the past, Bellabeat has the option to remarket her products to current users or those who have recently stopped using their products.
