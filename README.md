## DATA ANALYTICS PROJECT

### PROJECT 1 - REAL ESTATE

**Problem**
A real estate agency wanted to reduce the negotiation time and improve
closure for buyers and sellers of homes by ensuring that both sides were advised well on the potential
sale/purchase price of the home. To that end the agency wanted to predict a transaction price for all the
houses in its market which would be as close as possible to a price where the transaction would take place.
Data regarding all possible variables and qualities of over 10,000 houses sold in the past was collected and
analyzed.
**Solution**: Created a predictive model using linear regression and implemented CvTuning with the help of
Random forest and GBM to arrive at a potential transaction price for all future transactions. Over the next 6
months, negotiation time was brought down from 27 days on average to 8 days. Deal closure went up by
19%.

**Problem**
A retail giant needs to plan its new store openings over the next 12-18 months and
has multiple locations where the stores can be opened. It wants to understand which locations would be
the best to open new stores in terms of market size and potential revenues. Relevant data regarding
locations, population, sales and revenues of key products for stores opened in the past was provided to
be analyzed and for model building.
**Solution**: Created a Random Forest and Logistic regression models to predict if a store should be opened
or not in that particular location. Random Forest worked out to be a better model and Approximately 25
locations were selected to open new stores based on this analysis.
